	all requests get redirected to the dns server.
	Facebook, and other sites, and you wouldn't tell. (can track creditionals)

	[SQL Injections] - simply passing sql curies to http request, if server-side is not formated can cause a serious problem. a lot of websites are vulnerable

	[VPN] - Fast. Routs all traffic to VPN provider, heavly encrypted. No real way to track you unless VPN provider gives it up.

	[Proxy] - Slow. socks5 proxys, proxy chains, routs your connection to several proxies. (connecting to a lot of proxies slow internet)

	[Tor] - much faster than proxy, less faster than vpn. Can route traffic to certain routes. Ways to track you, but 99% of time you're fine. Access to dark web. (.onion websites)

	[Firewall] - dont use windows, linux firewall is open source and has a ridiculous amounts of options. ip tables command?

	[Reverse-shells] - Program which infects a device, then that program opens up a reverse connection to from that device back to you.
	you can pass commands and control the system even if you arent near it. Some routers have firewalls, which you need to address.
	but usually you do private devices, attack home router, change dns server there, and then steal or extract information.
